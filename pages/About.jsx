        <h2>About Rock-It</h2>
      <p>
        Prepare for liftoff! Rock-It is your personal mission control for daily
        tasks, designed to help you launch into productivity and achieve your
        daily objectives. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Created by two aspiring web developers, Victor (Brazil) and Francesco
        (Italy), we're training to become the astronauts of the digital
        age, and this app is one of our early launch vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that even the smallest tasks are important missions in our
        daily lives. Rock-It is here to ensure that no mission is left behind.
        Use it to track your progress, check off completed objectives, and
        confidently navigate your day.
